"Moodie 
 * a full stack responsive web application 
 * uses Node, Express, Handlebars and mySQL (MVC).
 * uses Face ++ API facial recognition software to analyze photos and display results based on the user facial expressions.
 * Moodie evaluates 7 different micro expressions: 
    - Happiness
    - Sadness
    - Disgust
    - Anger
    - Fear
    - Neutral
    - Surpise

The web application accesses the users webcam and/or camera phone to let the user take photos of themselves. Moodie will choose a random emotion and the user must try and take a photo of themself making that expression. The user will get results instantly letting them know how closely they matched the chosen expression.

Users can choose to save their images into a gallery. The gallery is categorized by emotion and the images displayed are shown in order of closest match to least closest match. These images are saved in a mySQL database." (Klayton Liekkio)
